INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:


To install Polya, simply place the file containing the sources in any
directory, and add that directory to the python path, e.g.

> export PYTHONPATH=PYTHONPATH:path/to/polya

Running Polya with the Fourier-Motzkin module requires nothing
extra. However to take advantage of the geometric methods, you will
need to have installed the following software:

1) GMP. 

2) CDD. 

3) LRS and Redund.
