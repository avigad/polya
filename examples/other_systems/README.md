Inequalities in other systems
=============================

This directory contains the following files, with data to support the discussion in Avigad, Lewis, and Roux (2014).

* isabelle_problems.thy: sample problems formalized in the Isabelle interactive theorem prover.

* z3_problems.py: sample problems tested on Z3 via Z3's Python bindings.

* metitarski_problems.tptp: sample problems in MetiTarski format.

In each case, comments in the file provide additional information. You can run z3_problems.py from the command line:

  python z3_problems.py list
  python z3_problems.py 12
  python z3_problems.py test_all
