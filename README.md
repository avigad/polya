The Polya Inequality Prover
===========================

Authors: Jeremy Avigad, Robert Y. Lewis, Cody Roux

Polya is a system designed to support interactive theorem proving by verifying the kinds of inequalities that arise in ordinary mathematical arguments. The method is described in the paper "A heuristic prover for real inequalities," available [online](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/Papers/polya.pdf). The system is still an experimental prototype, and feedback is very welcome.

The system is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

For instructions on setting up and using Polya, see INSTALL.md. There are tutorial examples in

    examples/examples.py
    
and additional information in the folder "doc".
